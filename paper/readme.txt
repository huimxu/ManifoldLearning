nonlinear DR methods:
ISOMAP/LLE/LE

linear DR methods:
LPP/NPE

a general framework for DR:
GE: In graph embedding, theunderlying merits and shortcomings of different dimensionality reduction schemes, existing or new, are revealed by differences inthe designoftheir intrinsic and penalty graphs and their types of embedding.

add some discriminant information:
LPDP(LPP+mmc)£ºcombining manifold criterion and Fisher criterion has more discriminanting power

GRSDA:seeks a subspace in which samples in intra-classes are as compact as possible while samples in inter-classes are as separable as possible.

modify the similarity matrix£ºSR or CR ?
sparse representation(SR):SPP/DSNPE/GRSDA/SLPDP/SRC
collaborative representation(CR):CRP/CRRP
add  neighbor relation(similarity-weighted):SWCRC
